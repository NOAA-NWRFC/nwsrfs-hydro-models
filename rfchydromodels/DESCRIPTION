Description: Provides functions to call Fortran versions of NWS operational 
             hydrology models, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA), 
             Snow Accumulation and Ablation (SNOW17). Also provides an 
             interface to the unit hydrograph routing model, consumptive use 
             and channel loss/gain modules. The Fortran code used in this package 
             is considered "legacy" and is not supported officially by NWS,
             but it should not have any significant differences from current 
             operational models.
